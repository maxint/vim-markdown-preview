# Markdown Preview

Instance Markdown preview support for vim.
Thanks for [lepture/mistune](https://github.com/lepture/mistune)
(The fastest markdown parser in pure Python with renderer feature, inspired by marked and misaka).
There is no external dependencies, and only vim with python enabled (`+python`) is required.

# Install

- Extract the files and put them in your vim directory (usual `~/.vim`)
- Or, install it by using [Vundle.vim](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) or
  other vim plug-in managers.

```vim
Vundle 'maxint/vim-markdown-preview'
```
